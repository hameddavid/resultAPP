He did his post-doctoral research in Molecular Biology and Genomics at the Harvard University, School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA (2000-2003).

In addition, I am passionate about building research capacity and human resource through training and mentoring activities.<br \/>\r\nThrough my research, we have been able to identify molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of malaria. We recently discovered new viruses (EKV-1 and EKV-2, and developed new rapid diagnoses for Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Lassa fever virus. <br \/>\r\nMy laboratory confirmed the first case of Ebola Virus Disease in Nigeria in the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and work with Nigerian Health Officials for the successful containment of the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria.  <br \/>\r\nResearch work in my laboratory contributed significantly to the establishment of the global reference for human genetic variation.  Our research work has also resulted in identification of new genes associated with human resistance to infection to Lassa fever virus.","nationality":"Cameroon","office_phone":"","p_address":"Redeemer%27s University Campus","p_email":"christianhappi@hotmail.com","pob":"International","poblga":"","r_address":"Redeemer%27s University Campus","sh_staff_no":"SS0536","signature":".\/media\/7397281104732.gif","staff_no":"RUN\/REG\/SS\/PF\/536","state_origin":"International","title":"Prof"},
